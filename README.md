## Install
* Clone repository to local device.
* Open the index.html, css file and script.js file and will find the day planner with time blocks from 9am-5pm. If current time is in the past, present or future the time blocks will display those colors respectively.
* Enter any kind of information in the blocks and click the save button and refresh the page and if the text is still present, then its working fine.

## Credits
* To my tutor, colleagues, google, W3schools and various videos on youtube.
